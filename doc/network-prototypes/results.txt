Both zmq and grpc are sufficient for our purposes, performance-wise.

zmq is, for our purposes, a much better socket library that has more
feature-rich sockets.

grpc is a layer above sockets, and implements distributed system functinality.
Also, protobufs are baked into grpc which is useful since we're going to be
using protobufs for communication anyway.

Since our system is a distributed system, grpc is better for our purposes.
