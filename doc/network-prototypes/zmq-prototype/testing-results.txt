I've tested this, with my setup being a laptop connected to wifi in the same
city but a couple streets away from corn-syrup.csclub.uwaterloo.ca.
The number of subclients seems to not affect how often updates are received.
With one or thirty clients, the server publishes once a second and clients
receive an update once a second.

It seems that updates are lost only when the size of the update grows large.
At <30 kb per update, all updates are received. As updates get larger, updates
seem to take longer to send. This shouldn't matter, but the time between
the client receiving an update and the size of an update seem to be linear.
That is, as the size of the update grows linearly, a client will first get an
update every couple seconds, then every five seconds, then every ten seconds.
That part of the experiment wasn't important, so I didn't do any hard analysis
on that.

Suffice to say that it looks like pyzmq will be sufficient for our needs for
networking!
